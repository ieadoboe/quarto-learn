    "text": "What is Deep Learning?\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence ‚Äúdeep‚Äù) to analyze various forms of data. Think of it as teaching computers to learn like humans do - through experience and examples rather than explicit programming.\nMuch like how a child learns to recognize cats not by memorizing rules about whiskers and tails, but by seeing thousands of examples, deep learning models learn patterns directly from data. The key difference? These models can process millions of examples at incredible speeds, finding patterns too subtle or complex for humans to detect manually."
