    "text": "What is Deep Learning?\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence “deep”) to analyze various forms of data. Think of it as teaching computers to learn like humans do - through experience and examples rather than explicit programming.\nMuch like how a child learns to recognize cats not by memorizing rules about whiskers and tails, but by seeing thousands of examples, deep learning models learn patterns directly from data. The key difference? These models can process millions of examples at incredible speeds, finding patterns too subtle or complex for humans to detect manually."

    "text": "Multi-Armed Bandit Problem\nImagine you’re in a Vegas casino with a row of slot machines (the “bandits” - they’re called one-armed bandits because of the lever).\nEach machine has different odds of paying out, but you don’t know which ones are better. You have limited money and time. Your challenge: figure out which machines are the best while still making money.\nThis is the multi-armed bandit problem - how do you balance exploring new options to find the best one, versus exploiting what you already know works?\n\nExamine Scenario\nLet’s say you have 3 coffee shops near your office:\n\nJoe’s Java: You’ve been there 5 times, it’s decent (7/10 rating)\nBean Scene: You tried it once, it was amazing (9/10)\nCafé Mystery: You’ve never tried it\n\nEach morning, you face the bandit problem:\n\nKeep going to Bean Scene (exploit your best known option)?\nTry Café Mystery (explore to potentially find something better)?\nGive Joe’s more chances (gather more data)?\n\nIf you only exploit, you might miss an even better coffee shop. If you only explore, you waste money on potentially bad coffee.\n\n\nReal-World Applications\n\nOnline Advertising: Which ad version gets the most clicks? Companies test different versions while still showing profitable ones.\nNetflix Recommendations: Which movies to suggest? Netflix balances showing you movies similar to what you liked (exploit) vs. new genres you might enjoy (explore).\nClinical Trials: Which treatment works best? Doctors must balance giving patients proven treatments vs. testing new ones.\nRestaurant Apps: DoorDash decides which restaurants to show first - popular ones you’ll likely order from, or new ones you might love.\n\nThe key insight is that information has value - sometimes it’s worth taking a suboptimal choice now to learn something that helps you make better choices later.\nNow, let me challenge an implicit assumption in how this problem is often framed: Is pure optimization always the goal?\nIn real life, variety itself has value. Humans get bored. The “best” coffee shop might not be best every day. Perhaps the real problem isn’t just finding the optimal choice, but maintaining a satisfying portfolio of choices over time.\nLet’s delve into the theory behind the multi-armed bandit problem.\n\nChoice amongst R options at each time step. Step\nreturns a numerical reward sampled from a reward distribution.\n\nGoal: Maximize expected total reward over time.\nLet A_t be action selected at time t.\n\nR_t is the reward received at time t.\n\nValue of an Action q_*(a) = E(R_t|A_t = a) (a = choice of a given machine)\nBut since we do not know q_*(a), the true action-value function, we must estimate it.\nIf we know q_*(a), for every possible choice of a , we always pick the a which maximizes it. Denote the estimate by Q(a).\nIdeally, Q(a) should converge to q_*(a).\n\n\nHow do we choose Q_t(a)?\nOne possibility is to use the average of all rewards received for action a up to time t.:\n\nQ_t(a) = \\frac{\\text{total rewards for }a}{\\text{Number of times }a \\text{ was performed}}\n\n\nQ_t(a) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1}{R_i I(A_i=a)}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1}{I(A_i=a)}}\n\n“Action-Value” methods\nQ_t(a) \\implies q_*(a) by Law of Large Numbers (LLN).\n\n\nHow do we use this for decision-making?\n\n“Greedy” Action Selection\nA_t = \\arg\\max_a{Q_t(a)} ties ave broken at random Q_t(a) is initialized to be 0, for all a. This means that at time t, we choose the action (A) that gives us the maximum expected reward according to our current estimate of the Q-value for each possible action.\nimport jax\n\n# Greedy action selection\n“\\epsilon-Greedy” Method\nUse greedy action selection most of the time. “Occasionally”, with probability \\epsilon &gt; 0, select an action amongst all possible actions uniformly at random. Eventually guaranteed to estimate all q_*(a) (but might not be practical).\nimport jax\n\n# Epsilon-Greedy action selection\n\n# Do some visualizations for different values of epsilon\n# for say 1000 simulations, and 1000 time steps\n\nInitial values affect the outcome of a run.\nIdea: We can choose larger initial values to encourage exploration.\nE.g. Q_t(a) = 5 (large relative to the means of the reward distributions) will encourage more exploration.\nIn conclusion, initial values matter for determining how much exploration happens early in the learning process.",
